    notes: "In response to public dissent, the Prime Minister announced that the clock change would, officially, take effect from Thursday 2023-03-30 00:00; however, as many who resisted the original change had already moved their clocks forward from Sunday 2023-03-26 00:00, tzdata has modeled this as a simple reversion of the change released in 2023b."
